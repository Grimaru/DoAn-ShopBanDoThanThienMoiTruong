### Our project for the Basic Web Coding subject.  
#### Main coder: Grimaru  
#### Email: rinnenguyenlife4u@gmail.com (sub: 22dh112315@st.huflit.edu.vn)  
#### It's been a long time since I last used Visual Studio 2019 (my actual major is data science so I completely changed from using Visual Studio 2019 with C# to using Google Colab, Visual Studio Code attached with Anaconda Navigator with Python) so there will be no update in the future.
